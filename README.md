## Regression

In the **regression** directory, there are two Jupyter Notebooks containing the training and evaluation of the following models:

* RM-Linear_Regression.ipynb
* RM-Gaussian_Process_Regressor.ipynb

Running all cells in those notebooks will train the models using the test data X_train.csv and y_train, then make predictions for unseen data in X_test.csv. However, both will output a file of the same name, "my_submission.csv" containing predictions for the unseen data.

Additionally, they will auto-generate plots and store them in the linear_regression and gaussian_process_regressor folders.

## Classification

In the **classification** directory, there are two Jupyter Notebooks containing the training and evaluation of the following models:

* CM-Logistic_Regression.ipynb
* CM-Linear_Discriminant_Analysis.ipynb

Running all cells in those notebooks will train the models using the test data X_train.csv and y_train, then make predictions for unseen data in X_test.csv. However, both will output a file of the same name, "my_submission.csv" containing predictions for the unseen data.

Some screenshots from the evaluation section in the notebooks are stored in the Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis folders.
